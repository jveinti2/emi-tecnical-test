# Code Challenge EMI: Task Management Application

## Task 1: Project Setup

Set up a new Angular or ✅React project using a build tool of your choice (e.g., Angular CLI, Create React App). Ensure proper folder structure and initial configuration.

## Task 2: Task Component ✅

Create a reusable Task component that displays a task's details. The task details should include a title, description, due date, current state (show the last), and a section for notes about the task. Allow the user to edit and delete a task.

## Task 3: Task List ✅

Create a TaskList component that displays a list of tasks. Include the following features:

- Use state or props to manage the list of tasks.
- Use the file db.json to read and write the mock data.
- Display the tasks in the Task component.
- Implement pagination for the task list (show 5 tasks per page).
- Allow the user to mark a task as completed.

## Task 4: Task Form ✅

Create a TaskForm component that allows users to add new tasks. The form should include fields for the task title, description, due date, current state, and a section to notes (each note has a field per note). Implement form validation to ensure all fields are filled (it is only necessary to validate one field of the notes section).

## Task 5: Routing ✅

Implement routing using React Router (for React) or Angular Router (for Angular). Create routes for displaying the task list, task details, and adding a new task.

## Task 6: Access Data ✅

Implement state management using RxJs, React Context API (for React), or Angular services (for Angular). Ensure that the state is managed efficiently and components are updated appropriately when you call your services to Access the mock data of file db.json.

Gola! =================================================

## Task 8: Error Handling (Senior challenge)

Handle errors gracefully, especially during API requests. Display meaningful error messages to the user.

## Task 9: Performance Optimization (Senior challenge)

Implement one performance optimization strategy (e.g., lazy loading ✅, memoization) to enhance the application's performance.
